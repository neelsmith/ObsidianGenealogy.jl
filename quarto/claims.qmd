# Documented claims


*Documented claims*: a structure that groups a primary source document, an assertion about a specific type of claim, and one or more people involved in the claim.

Here are types of claims that this package currently recognizes:

- birth
- death 
- parents

Other types (many) will be added gradually.

:::{.callout-note title="Next TBA"}
- marriage
:::


```{julia}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
#| warning: false
repo = pwd() |> dirname
```

Use the same toy vault as other examples with notes on a couple of presidents:

```{julia}
#| warning: false
using Obsidian, ObsidianGenealogy
dir = joinpath(repo,"test", "assets", "presidents-vault")
genvault = genealogyVault(dir)
```

## Birth claims

```{julia}
lincolnbirth = birthrecords(genvault, "Abraham Lincoln")
```


## Death claims

```{julia}
lincolndeath = deathrecords(genvault, "Abraham Lincoln")
```
