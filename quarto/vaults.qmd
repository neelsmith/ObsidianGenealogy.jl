## Create a genealogy vault

A toy vault with notes on a couple of presidents:

```{julia}
using Obsidian, ObsidianGenealogy
dir = joinpath(repo,"test", "assets", "presidents-vault")
genvault = genealogyVault(dir)
```

## Transcribed primary sources

```{julia}
docs = documents(genvault)
```


## People identified in the notes

```{julia}
folks = people(genvault)
```

## Documented claims

*Documented claims*: a structure that groups a primary source document, an assertion about a specific type of claim, and one or more people involved in the claim.

Here are types of claims that this package currently recognizes:

- birth
- death 
- parents

Other types (many) will be added gradually.
